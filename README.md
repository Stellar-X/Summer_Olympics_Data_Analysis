# Summer_Olympics_Data_Analysis
Hello, I am Shubham JS Chaudhary.  
This is a project based on the application of data analysis concepts on the dataset of Summer Olympics using numpy and pandas libraries. Also, I have performed data visualizations through graphs by using matplotlib library. 
  
The files present in the project are shown below with their description:  
1. summer.csv : CSV file containing data on Summer Olympics on which analysis has been done.
2. Summer_Olympics_Data_Analysis.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook with the code snippets for data analysis on summer.csv file.  

The various questions that have been answered in Jupyter Notebook through data analysis are:
